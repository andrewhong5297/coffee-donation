<how_to_build_with_trails>
A Herd "trail" is a linear sequence of write functions across EVM contracts (referred to as "primary nodes" or "steps"), where the creator determines how function input values will be derived (derive_method, covered in <how_input_values_and_source_nodes_work>). The consumer of the trail will fill in user inputs and then submit one transaction for each step. You are building for the consumer of the trail. Trails come with an API that can be built on top of.

Here is your plan:
1. Read and understand the steps and inputs of the trail, and how the data flows across source nodes to the primary node(s). The specific trail your are working with is described in the <trail_metadata> and <step_data> sections.
2. Build your code around the required user inputs for each step, in the format required for the evaluations API. You can reference the <submitting_inputs_to_get_transaction_calldata> section for this.
  - Double check you have copied the full node ids and flattened dot path of input names from the <step_data> section, you can test with cURL requests to see if you are passing API validations.
  - Make sure you are flattening array inputs correctly, see <working_with_array_inputs> for details.
3. Build the wallet connection, and then a transaction submission handler with wagmi/viem that calls the evaluations API, submits the transaction to the blockchain, and immediately pushes the transaction hash to the executions API. You can reference the <setting_up_wallet_connection_and_transaction_submission> and <mandatory_updating_executions_after_transaction> sections for this.
4. Manage the user wallet's trail execution history, where each execution contains transactions across steps. Use this as the source of truth for step state (enabling/disabling other steps). You can reference the <execution_history> section for this.
5. Utilize the read API to provide extra data to the user before or after each step is executed. Make sure to adjust the output values of any onchain data nodes to the correct decimals.
  - Any onchain data the user wants to access when building on a trail must be accessible from either the read nodes or from the hardcoded values in primary/source node inputs. They can visit the overlook link to fork the trail and add their own read nodes if they wish.

<api_endpoints>
The Trail API endpoints are as follows:

<evaluations_api>
**Get transaction calldata for a step**
- Endpoint: POST https://trails-api.herd.eco/v1/trails/:trailId/versions/:versionId/steps/:stepNumber/evaluations
- Description: Build your app to get the required user inputs for a given step, then pass into here to evaluate the user inputs and get the transaction calldata. More details are in the <submitting_inputs_to_get_transaction_calldata> section.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "walletAddress": "0x...", // 42 character hex ethereum address
  //these must exactly match the spellings of the nodeId and inputName's of the 'requiredUserInputs' in the <step_data> section. remember to use the full flattened dot path of input names, not just the last part of the path.
  "userInputs": {
    "nodeId": {
      "some.dot.path.to.input": {
        "value": "someValue" // value should always be wrapped in quotes, even if it's a number or array or boolean
      },
      "someOther.dot.path.to.input": {
        "value": "someOtherValue"
      }
    },
    "someOtherNodeId": {
      // ... additional node inputs
    }
  },
  //the default is "latest", if you want to use a specific execution, you can pass in the executionId
  "execution": { "type": "latest" } | {" type": "new" }  | { "type": "manual", "executionId": "uuid for the execution" }
}
```

**Response Body:**
```json
{
  "finalInputValues": {
    "some.dot.path.to.input": "someValue",
    "someOther.dot.path.to.input": "someOtherValue"
  },
  "finalPayableAmount": "someWeiValue", // native value sent in transaction
  "finalContractAddress": "0x...", // address of the contract to call (the "to" address of the transaction)
  "callData": "0x...", // calldata to submit to the user wallet for signing (the "data" of the transaction)
}
```
</evaluations_api>

<executions_api>
**Save transaction hash after submission**
- Endpoint: POST https://trails-api.herd.eco/v1/trails/:trailId/versions/:versionId/executions
- Description: After a user wallet submits a transaction using the calldata, pass the step primary nodeId and the transaction hash here to save it on the execution. This also creates a new execution if one doesn't exist yet for the wallet address. More details are in the <mandatory_updating_executions_after_transaction> section.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "nodeId": "the uuid of the primary node for this step",
  "transactionHash": "the hash of the transaction submitted by the user wallet",
  "walletAddress": "the wallet address of the user submitting the transaction",
  //the default is "latest", if you want to use a specific execution, you can pass in the executionId
  "execution": { "type": "latest" } | {" type": "new" }  | { "type": "manual", "executionId": "uuid for the execution" }
}
```

This will return an error if the transaction hash is not valid/failed.
</executions_api>

<execution_history_api>
**Query execution history for the trail**
- Endpoint: POST https://trails-api.herd.eco/v1/trails/:trailId/versions/:versionId/executions/query
- Description: Get all executions for a trail, grouped by wallet address (always lowercase). You can filter the wallet addresses in the body. More details on using this data is in the <execution_history> section.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "walletAddresses": ["0x...", "0x..."] // array of wallet addresses to filter by
}
```

**Response Body:**
```json
{
  "totals": {
    "transactions": "total number of transactions across all wallets (filtered by walletAddresses, that have completed more than just step 0)",
    "wallets": "total number of wallets that have executed the trail (filtered by walletAddresses, that have completed more than just step 0)"
  },
  //this contains all the executions for the trail, grouped by wallet address (always lowercase). do not merge/flatten executions across wallets.
  "executions": {
    "someWalletAddress": {
      //each execution is a different set of step transactions for the wallet. Do not merge/flatten across executions, they should be used independently.
      "executions": [
        {
          "id": "uuid for execution",
          "createdAt": "when execution was created",
          "updatedAt": "last time a step was added to the execution",
          "steps": [
            {
              "stepNumber": 1,
              "nodeId": "uuid for the primary node for this step",
              "txHash": "hash of the transaction submitted by the user wallet",
              "createdAt": "when the step was created"
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "farcasterData": {
        "username": "username, can link to the farcaster profile with https://farcaster.xyz/username",
        "pfp_url": "url to the farcaster profile picture",
        "display_name": "display name of the farcaster profile",
        "fid": "farcaster id",
        "bio": "bio of the farcaster profile",
        "followers": "number of followers",
        "following": "number of people the user is following"
      } | null // they might not have a farcaster profile, so this can be null
    }
    // ... other wallet addresses
  }
}
```

<read_node_api>
**Get the data outputs from any node**
- Endpoint: POST https://trails-api.herd.eco/v1/trails/:trailId/versions/:versionId/nodes/:nodeId/read
- Description: Get the data outputs from any read node by node id (see the readNodes array in the <step_data> section). Requires same submission logic as the evaluations API. More details are in the <reading_data_outputs_from_nodes> section.

**Request Body:**
Same exact format as the evaluations API request body. If there is no connected wallet, you can pass in the "walletAddress" as "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000".

**Response Body:**
All responses will have an "outputs" object, but the format will depend on the node type (found on "nodeMetadata.type" with the values of "read_function", "write_function", "event", "code").

There are two main formats for outputs, one is the "flattened_dot_path" format that is a Record<DotPathString, ReturnValueString> that we already use for the evaluations API, and the other is a "nested_json" format which looks like the following:

```json
{
  //for the nested_json format, the first level key is the argument name, if there is no name then it's arg_{index}
  "arg_0": {
      "name": "",
      "type": "tuple",
      //if the type is a tuple or an array, then the value will be a nested array of objects with the same format of { name, type, value }.
      "value": [
        {
          "name": "base",
          "type": "uint256",
          "value": "31680878000"
        },
        {
          "name": "premium",
          "type": "uint256",
          "value": "0"
        }
      ]
    }
}
```

Here are the response formats for each node type:

```json
//"code" node type
{
  "inputs": flattened_dot_path
  "outputs": flattened_dot_path
}

//"event", "read_function", and "write_function" node types
{
  "inputs": nested_json
  "outputs": nested_json
}

The exact variable names can be found in the outputSchema field of the readNodes array in the <step_data> section.
```
</read_node_api>

**Important Notes:**
- Do not spam any of these APIs - avoid high frequency polling and useEffect calls when you can.
- All executions will have a stepNumber 0 to mark the trail was started, with a transaction hash of 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000. You should ignore this step when showing transaction details to users.
- Execution type can be either "latest" or "new", where "latest" is the execution that has most recently been updated (or created).

This trail is for the "base" blockchain (EVM). The time is currently 2025-07-04T01:39:13.043Z. If you have any questions or problems, you can dm @andrewhong5297 on twitter or telegram, @ilemi on farcaster, or andrew@herd.eco on email.


For each step of the trail, there is a main function being executed (the primary node) with a set of required inputs. You'll be able to find all this data in the <step_data> section below.

<how_input_values_and_source_nodes_work>
The 'value' for input values on the primary node each have a 'derive_method' that references another node. These other nodes can be found in the 'allSourceNodesForThisStep' from the API response. Data is built up as a user goes through steps, which is why there are sometimes source nodes from previous step numbers included.

The 'derive_method' set on the input defines how the 'value' will be evaluated:
- 'user_input' means the user will have to fill in the value
- 'user_wallet' means this will take the connected user's wallet address
- 'creator_hardcoded' means the creator of the trail has already filled in the value
- 'relational' means the value is derived from other contract nodes (read functions, events, past write functions)
- 'step_execution' means getting the transaction hash from an execution of a specific primary node/step, and is only used in event nodes (to look up event data in that transaction).
- 'code' means the value is derived from a typescript code execution

If 'derive_method' is 'relational' or 'code', you can find the node that the value is derived from in the 'derivedFromNodeId' field on the input.

Key information to keep mind about the inputs:
- Values for inputs that aren't 'user_input' can't be changed (including any existing array elements added by the creator, those can't be removed).
- Every input is a flattened dot '.' path (like a JSON path) representation of the input arguments. This flattened representation must be kept when you send the userInputs to the evaluations API.
- Any int type will have another '{variable}_decimals' value is used to multiply against the submitted value of the int variable because the EVM expects a raw bigint. You do NOT need to multiply by this decimal value before sending it to the evaluations API.
</how_input_values_and_source_nodes_work>

<submitting_inputs_to_get_transaction_calldata>
The required 'user_input' fields are found in the 'requiredUserInputs' on each node id in 'requiredInputsForPrimaryEvaluation' in the <step_data>.

You MUST send back all the 'requiredUserInputs' across all those nodes, with a filled in 'value' fields and the user's wallet address to the evaluations API (https://trails-api.herd.eco/v1/trails/:trailId/versions/:versionId/steps/:stepNumber/evaluations) with the required request body format.

If there are errors in the user inputs, you will see the error in the 'finalInputValues' object and request body validation.

<working_with_array_inputs>
Note that array element "inputNames" are flattened with the index, i.e. 'inputs.someArray.{index}' for each new element. And if it's a tuple array then its 'inputs.someTupleArray.{index}.{eachTupleComponent}'. The easiest way to create new elements is by copying from arrayDefaults.
Array defaults are meant to represent the default values for each newly added element, so they don't include the index in the dot path yet.

So within 'requiredUserInputs' you may see a type like 'inputs.someArray' that comes with arrayDefaults. If a user added two elements to this array then it would be added to 'userInputs' as:

```json
userInputs": {
    "nodeId": {
      "inputs.someArray": {
          "value": "" //the actual valueType = 'array' value should be always left as a blank string
      },
      "inputs.someArray.0": {
        "value": "someValue"
      },
      "inputs.someArray.1": {
        "value": "someOtherValue"
      }
      //if this value type has "int" in it, then the arrayDefaults will also contain a "inputs.someArray_decimals" value which would show up like this:
      "inputs.someArray.0_decimals": {
        "value": "someDecimalValue"
      },
      "inputs.someArray.1_decimals": {
        "value": "someOtherDecimalValue"
      }
    }
}
```

And if the array type is a 'tuple[]' then this will look like:

```json
userInputs": {
    "nodeId": {
      "inputs.someTupleArray": {
          "value": "" //the actual valueType = 'array' value should be always left as a blank string
      },
      //you would find this in arrayDefaults already as 'inputs.someTupleArray.componentA' and 'inputs.someTupleArray.componentB', and it may already have a value you can copy over.
      "inputs.someTupleArray.0.componentA": {
        "value": "someValue"
      },
      "inputs.someTupleArray.0.componentB": {
        "value": "someOtherValue"
      },
      "inputs.someTupleArray.1.componentA": {
        "value": "someValue"
      },
      "inputs.someTupleArray.1.componentB": {
        "value": "someOtherValue"
      }
  }
}
```

You only need to copy "user_input" fields from arrayDefaults, you don't need to copy any of the other fields when gathering the required user inputs. Sometimes the array/arrayDefaults intent may also say that you should not add any array elements, in which case you don't even need to surface this array input to the user.
</working_with_array_inputs>

The evaluations API will return the transaction calldata to submit to the user wallet for signing (sending a transaction to the blockchain).
</submitting_inputs_to_get_transaction_calldata>

<setting_up_wallet_connection_and_transaction_submission>
If you're building a web app, you'll need a connect wallet button. We like using the family connectkit library for this (https://family.co/docs/connectkit/getting-started) which uses wagmi/viem under the hood.

Here is how to setup connect kit:

```typescript
import { WagmiProvider, createConfig, http } from "wagmi";
import { mainnet } from "wagmi/chains";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { ConnectKitProvider, getDefaultConfig } from "connectkit";

const config = createConfig(
  getDefaultConfig({
    // Your dApps chains
    chains: [mainnet],
    transports: {
      // RPC URL for each chain
      [mainnet.id]: http(
        `https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_ID}`,
      ),
    },

    // Required API Keys
    walletConnectProjectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID, //you can set this to anything, it doesn't matter if you only want desktop wallet connections. To get a key you can go to https://reown.com/blog/walletconnect-is-now-reown

    // Required App Info
    appName: "Your App Name",

    // Optional App Info
    appDescription: "Your App Description",
    appUrl: "https://family.co", // your app's url
    appIcon: "https://family.co/logo.png", // your app's icon, no bigger than 1024x1024px (max. 1MB)
  }),
);

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export const Web3Provider = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={config}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        <ConnectKitProvider>{children}</ConnectKitProvider>
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
  );
};
```

And then placing it in the app:

```typescript
import { Web3Provider } from "./Web3Provider";
import { ConnectKitButton } from "connectkit";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Web3Provider>
      <ConnectKitButton />
    </Web3Provider>
  );
};
```

Do NOT create dummy transaction hashes when the user submits in the app, you should always send the transaction to the wallet to be submitted onchain. Here is a working example for sending a transaction and execution that you can copy:

```typescript
  import { useAccount, useSendTransaction, useSwitchChain } from 'wagmi'
  import { base } from "wagmi/chains";

  ...in component code...
  const { address, isConnected } = useAccount()
  const { switchChain } = useSwitchChain();

  //switch to the correct chain id for the trail
  useEffect(() => {
    switchChain({ chainId: base.id });
  }, [switchChain, address]);

  // You can use the useSendTransaction hook from wagmi (https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useSendTransaction).
  const { sendTransaction, isPending, error: txError } = useSendTransaction({
    mutation: {
      onSuccess: async (hash: string) => {
        console.log('Transaction successfully sent:', hash)
        try {
          // After confirming the transaction, send the transaction hash back to the executions API
          await fetch(
            `https://trails-api.herd.eco/v1/trails/:trailId/versions/:versionId/executions/:walletAddress/wallet`,
            {
              method: "POST",
              body: JSON.stringify({ nodeId: primaryNodeId, transactionHash: hash, walletAddress: address!, execution: { type: "latest" } }),
            },
          );
        } catch (err) {
          console.error('Failed to submit execution:', err)
        }
      },
      onError: (error: Error) => {
        console.error('Transaction failed:', error)
      }
    }
  })

  //where this goes in an onClick handler in the UI
  const handleSubmit = async (someInputArgsFromFrontend) => {
    // get the call arguments from the evaluations API
    const evaluation = await apiCallToGetEvaluationData(someInputArgsFromFrontend)

    // create transaction request
    const transactionRequest: {
      from: `0x${string}`,
      to: `0x${string}`,
      data: `0x${string}`,
      value: bigint,
    } = {
      from: address as `0x${string}`,
      to: evaluation.finalContractAddress as `0x${string}`,
      data: evaluation.callData as `0x${string}`,
      value: BigInt(evaluation.finalPayableAmount ?? "0"),
    }

    // send transaction onchain - success/error handling is done in the useSendTransaction callbacks
    sendTransaction(transactionRequest)
  }
```

If you are writing a standalone script (not a frontend app), you can just use viem (https://viem.sh/llms-full.txt) like this:

```typescript
import { createWalletClient, http, parseEther } from 'viem'
import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts'
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains'

const client = createWalletClient({
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http()
})

const account = privateKeyToAccount('0x...') //or mnemonicToAccount('seed phrase words')

//get the call arguments from the evaluations API
const evaluation = await apiCallToGetEvaluationData() //this is the evaluation data for the step/primary node

//send the transaction onchain
const hash = await client.sendTransaction({
  account,
  to: evaluation.finalContractAddress,
  value: parseEther(evaluation.finalPayableAmount ?? '0'),
  data: evaluation.callData,
})

//save the transaction hash to the executions API
await fetch(
  `https://trails-api.herd.eco/v1/trails/:trailId/versions/:versionId/executions`,
  {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({ nodeId: primaryNodeId, transactionHash: hash, walletAddress: account.address, execution: { type: "latest" } }),
  },
);
```
</setting_up_wallet_connection_and_transaction_submission>

<mandatory_updating_executions_after_transaction>
This execution API lets you create and/or update an "execution" for a trail by wallet address. Executions keep track of transactions a wallet has made for each step (primary node) in a trail.

After the user has submitted the transaction onchain in your app, you must call the executions post endpoint (https://trails-api.herd.eco/v1/trails/:trailId/versions/:versionId/executions).

Execution type can be either "latest" or "new", where "latest" is the execution that has most recently been updated (or created). Adding a new transaction to an execution counts as an update.

When submitting a transaction for a given primary nodeId, these are the backend behaviors:
- If you send with execution.type "new": create a new execution and append the transaction as step 1 to it.
- If you send with execution.type "latest", it will either:
  - add the transaction as a step to the "latest" execution if one exists
  - create a new "latest" execution if one doesn't exist, and add the transaction as a step to it
  - if a transaction already exists for this primary nodeId/step in the latest execution, it will "fork" that execution to create a new execution with the same previous step transaction data and append the new transaction to it.
- If you send with execution.type "manual" with an executionId, it will add the transaction as a step to the execution with the given executionId.
</mandatory_updating_executions_after_transaction>

<execution_history>
To get all executions of a trail, you can use the following execution query POST API (https://trails-api.herd.eco/v1/trails/:trailId/versions/:versionId/executions/query). Note that for a given wallet, each "execution" is a different set of step transactions. Do not merge/flatten across executions, they should be used independently. You should always rely on executions from the API as the source of truth for step/component state, do not try and create a local state.

Execution history is used to derive the current step number a user (wallet address) is on in the trail - you should hide/disable previous steps and any steps that come after the current step.

All executions will have a stepNumber 0 to mark the trail was started, with a transaction hash of 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000. You should filter out this step when showing the user any details/counts about transactions. The actual trail steps start counting from 1.

You should have two components/queries:
- one component showing the execution history of the connected wallet (query once with just the user's wallet address in walletAddresses, anytime the connected address changes/transaction is submitted) - make sure there is an empty state if there are no executions yet by the user. Show each execution (by id) in a collapsible card, which expands to show each step taken (the tx hash, and the step number). The user should be able to select an execution to be used in the app as the main "selectedExecution" state using a checkbox on the execution card, which then informs the app of the current step number.
- one component showing the executions of other wallets that have executed the trail (query once with an empty walletAddresses array to get all executions from all addresses, on page load). You should show the profile picture and username of the wallet (or just the wallet if farcaster data is unavailable), and sum the total unique transaction hashes across their executions in a "X transactions sent" text underneath.

Executions will only be updated after you submit a transaction, you should not poll it constantly for updates.
</execution_history>

<reading_data_outputs_from_nodes>
The read API is used to get the data outputs from any node by id. Note that if you are getting the outputs of the primary node, that step number must have already been executed (transaction posted to the executions API).

This API is most useful for providing extra data the user before or after execution, which could inform the user if a step is still valid to be executed (a crowdfund may have ended already, or all NFTs may have been sold out).

The API is intended for getting data about one execution at a time (the user's selected/current execution). This read API is not meant to be used for bulk historical data queries across executions - don't try to get data about every transaction across all executions without paginating/limiting results to five executions at a time.

The outputs from read_function/write_function/event are "raw" from onchain and need decimal adjustments, check the <step_data> section to find the correct decimals and then ask the user to clarify.
