<how_to_build_farcaster_miniapp_with_trails>
A Herd "trail" is a linear sequence of write functions across EVM contracts (referred to as "primary nodes" or "steps"), where the creator of the trail (trailblazer) determines how function input values will be derived (derive_method, covered in <how_input_values_and_source_nodes_work>). The consumer of the trail will fill in user inputs and then submit one transaction for each step. Trails come with an API that can be built on top of.

You are helping a developer build a "farcaster_miniapp" on top of this trail. Miniapps are displayed in mobile, so you should design and optimize the app for mobile viewing. Be sure to maintain organized folder and file structures for functions/components, don't jam everything into one file. They may already have an existing project, and just want to integrate the trails API into the code - in that case, focus only on the API integration of the steps and do not make major changes to the rest of the repository.

<plan>
Here is your plan:
1. Read and understand the steps and inputs of the trail, and how the data flows across source nodes to the primary node(s). The specific trail your are working with is described in the <trail_metadata> and <step_data> sections.
2. Build your UI components around the required user inputs for each step, in the format required for the evaluations API. You can reference the <submitting_inputs_to_get_transaction_calldata> section for this.
  - Double check you have copied the full node ids and flattened dot path of input names from the <step_data> section, you can test with cURL requests to see if you are passing API validations.
  - Make sure you are flattening array inputs correctly, see <working_with_array_inputs> for details. Take into account existing elements and the arrayMaxLength for each array.
  - Don't pad decimals on int inputs, unless the decimals value is set to 0 and you really think you need to. Most trails should already take care of stuff like token or percentage decimals in the {variable}_decimals field, so you only need to pass the actual value.
  - Each component should be loaded based on the execution history, such that the past step must be completed before the next step is enabled/shown. Completed steps should have the component collapsed, but allow the consumer to re-execute it if they want to.
3. Build the wallet connection with just the farcaster connector, showing the farcaster username from context, and then a sendTransaction hook with wagmi/viem that calls the evaluations API, submits the transaction to the blockchain, and immediately pushes the transaction hash to the executions API. You can reference the <setting_up_wallet_connection_and_transaction_submission> and <mandatory_updating_executions_after_transaction> sections for this.
  - The miniapp should automatically attempt to connect when the page loads in a useEffect.
4. Manage the consumer wallet's trail execution history, where each execution contains transactions across steps. Use this as the source of truth for step state (enabling/disabling other steps). You can reference the <execution_history> section for this.
  - Show the community's execution history in a separate component too.
  - If the post to the executions API fails, this likely means the transaction itself has failed - you should ALWAYS return a transaction error to the consumer and still give them the hash to investigate.
5. Utilize execution history and the read API to provide extra data to the consumer before or after each step is executed. Make sure to adjust the output values of any onchain data nodes to the correct decimals.
  - Any onchain data the consumer wants to access when building on a trail must be accessible from either the read nodes or from the hardcoded values in primary/source node inputs. They can visit the overlook link to fork the trail and add their own read nodes if they wish.
  - The read API can be used to enhance data about an execution too, providing stuff like "amount transferred", "token symbol", etc. Be sure to provide the right wallet address and execution id combination when calling the read API.

<how_input_values_and_source_nodes_work>
The 'value' for input values on the primary node each have a 'derive_method' that references another node. These other nodes can be found in the 'allSourceNodesForThisStep' from the API response. Data is built up as a consumer goes through steps, which is why there are sometimes source nodes from previous step numbers included.

The 'derive_method' set on the input defines how the 'value' will be evaluated:
- 'user_input' means the consumer will have to fill in the value
- 'user_wallet' means this will take the connected consumer's wallet address
- 'creator_hardcoded' means the creator of the trail has already filled in the value
- 'relational' means the value is derived from other contract nodes (read functions, events, past write functions)
- 'step_execution' means getting the transaction hash from an execution of a specific primary node/step, and is only used in event nodes (to look up event data in that transaction).
- 'code' means the value is derived from a typescript code execution
- 'encode_calldata' means the value is derived from the encoded calldata of a write function

If 'derive_method' is 'relational' or 'code', you can find the node that the value is derived from in the 'derivedFromNodeId' field on the input.

Key information to keep mind about the inputs:
- Any int type will have another '{inputName}_decimals' value is used to multiply against the submitted value, because the EVM expects a raw bigint. You do NOT need to multiply by some decimal value before sending it to the evaluations API.
- Values for inputs that aren't 'user_input' can't be changed (including any existing array elements added by the creator, those can't be removed).
- Every input is a flattened dot '.' path (like a JSON path) representation of the input arguments. This flattened representation must be kept when you send the userInputs to the evaluations API.

<api_endpoints>
The Trail API endpoints are as follows. Do not spam call/poll any of these endpoints in your code, warn the developer if they are doing/asking for this.

<evaluations_api>
**Get transaction calldata for a step**
- Endpoint: POST https://trails-api.herd.eco/v1/trails/:trailId/versions/:versionId/steps/:stepNumber/evaluations
- Description: Get the required inputs for a given step from the consumer, then pass into this endpoint to get the transaction calldata, contract address, and payable amount. More details are in the <how_input_values_and_source_nodes_work> and <submitting_inputs_to_get_transaction_calldata> sections.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "walletAddress": "0x...", // 42 character hex ethereum address
  //these must exactly match the spellings of the nodeId and inputName's of the 'requiredUserInputs' in the <step_data> section. remember to use the full flattened dot path of input names, not just the last part of the path.
  "userInputs": {
    "nodeId": {
      "some.dot.path.to.input": {
        "value": "someValue" // value should always be wrapped in quotes, even if it's a number or array or boolean
      },
      "someOther.dot.path.to.input": {
        "value": "someOtherValue"
      }
    },
    "someOtherNodeId": {
      // ... additional node inputs
    }
  },
  //the default is "latest", if you want to use a specific execution, you can pass in the executionId
  "execution": { "type": "latest" } | {" type": "new" }  | { "type": "manual", "executionId": "uuid for the execution" }
}
```

**Response Body:**
```json
{
  "finalInputValues": {
    "some.dot.path.to.input": "someValue",
    "someOther.dot.path.to.input": "someOtherValue"
  },
  "payableAmount": "someWeiValue", // native value sent in transaction
  "contractAddress": "0x...", // address of the contract to call (the "to" address of the transaction)
  "callData": "0x...", // calldata to submit to the consumer wallet for signing (the "data" of the transaction)
}
```
</evaluations_api>

<executions_api>
**Save transaction hash after submission**
- Endpoint: POST https://trails-api.herd.eco/v1/trails/:trailId/versions/:versionId/executions
- Description: After a consumer wallet submits a transaction using the calldata, pass the step primary nodeId and the transaction hash here to save it on the execution. This also creates a new execution if one doesn't exist yet for the wallet address. More details are in the <mandatory_updating_executions_after_transaction> section.

You do NOT need to create an execution beforehand for the user, and should usually use the "latest" execution type unless the consumer has selected a different execution id.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "nodeId": "the uuid of the primary node for this step",
  "transactionHash": "the hash of the transaction submitted by the consumer wallet",
  "walletAddress": "the wallet address of the consumer submitting the transaction",
  //the default is "latest", if you want to use a specific execution, you can pass in the executionId
  "execution": { "type": "latest" } | {" type": "new" }  | { "type": "manual", "executionId": "uuid for the execution" }
}
```

This will return an error if the transaction hash is not valid/failed.
</executions_api>

<execution_history_api>
**Query execution history for the trail**
- Endpoint: POST https://trails-api.herd.eco/v1/trails/:trailId/versions/:versionId/executions/query
- Description: Get all executions for a trail, grouped by wallet address (always lowercase). You can filter the wallet addresses in the body, which applies only to the "walletExecutions" array (totals always returns unfiltered). More details on using this data is in the <execution_history> section.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "walletAddresses": ["0x...", "0x..."] // array of wallet addresses to filter by
}
```

**Response Body:**
```json
{
  "totals": {
    "transactions": "total number of transactions across all wallets (filtered by walletAddresses, that have completed more than just step 0)",
    "wallets": "total number of wallets that have executed the trail (filtered by walletAddresses, that have completed more than just step 0)",

          }\
        ]
      }
      // ... stats for other step numbers, undefined if no transactions yet for any given step.
    }
  },
  // this returns all the executions from the POST body "walletAddresses". do not merge/flatten executions across wallets.
  "walletExecutions": [\
    {\

              "createdAt": "when the step was created"\
            }\
          ]\

      }\
    }\
    // ... other wallet executions\
  ]
}
```
</execution_history_api>

<read_node_api>
**Get the data outputs from any node**
- Endpoint: POST https://trails-api.herd.eco/v1/trails/:trailId/versions/:versionId/nodes/:nodeId/read
- Description: You MUST pass an executionId in the request body when trying to get data amount a specific execution. Get the data outputs from any read node by node id (see the readNodes array in the <step_data> section). Requires same submission logic as the evaluations API. More details are in the <how_input_values_and_source_nodes_work> section.

**Request Body:**
Same schema format as the evaluations API request body, however the required inputs will be different (and can be found in <step_data> for the given read node id). If there is no connected wallet, you can pass in the "walletAddress" as "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000".

**Response Body:**
All responses will have an "inputs" and "outputs" object, but the format will depend on the node type (found on "nodeMetadata.type" with the values of "read_function", "write_function", "event", "code").

There are two main formats, one is the "flattened_dot_path" format that is a Record<DotPathString, ReturnValueString> that we already use for the evaluations API, and the other is a "nested_json" format which looks like the following:

```json
{
  //for the nested_json format, the first level key is the argument name, if there is no name then it's arg_{index}
  "arg_0": {
      "name": "",
      "type": "tuple",
      //if the type is a tuple or an array, then the value will be a nested array of objects with the same format of { name, type, value }.
      "value": [\
        {\
          "name": "base",\
          "type": "uint256",\
          "value": "31680878000"\
        },\
        {\
          "name": "premium",\
          "type": "uint256",\
          "value": "0"\
        }\
      ]
    }
}
```

Here are the response formats for each node type:

```json
//"code" node type
{
  "inputs": flattened_dot_path
  "outputs": flattened_dot_path
}

//"event", "read_function", and "write_function" node types
{
  "inputs": nested_json
  "outputs": nested_json
}

```

The exact variable names can be found in the outputSchema field of the readNodes array in the <step_data> section.

The read API is used to get the data outputs from any node by id for any given execution id. Note that if you are calling a "readAfterExecution = true" node, then the step number must already have been executed (transaction posted to the executions API).

This API is most useful for providing extra data the consumer before or after executing a step, which can inform the consumer if a step is still valid to be executed (a crowdfund may have ended already, or all NFTs may have been sold out).

The outputs from read_function/write_function/event are "raw" from onchain and need decimal adjustments, check the <step_data> section to find the correct decimals and then ask the consumer to clarify.
</read_node_api>

**Important Notes:**
- Do not spam any of these APIs - avoid high frequency polling and useEffect calls when you can.
- All executions will have a stepNumber 0 to mark the trail was started, with a transaction hash of 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000. You should ignore this step when showing transaction details to consumers.
- Execution type can be either "latest" or "new", where "latest" is the execution that has most recently been updated (or created).
</api_endpoints>

For each step of the trail, there is a main function being executed (the primary node) with a set of required inputs. You'll be able to find all this data in the <step_data> section below.

<submitting_inputs_to_get_transaction_calldata>
The required 'user_input' fields are found in the 'requiredUserInputs' on each node id in 'requiredInputsForPrimaryEvaluation' in the <step_data>.

You MUST send back all the 'requiredUserInputs' across all those nodes, with a filled in 'value' fields and the consumer's wallet address to the evaluations API (https://trails-api.herd.eco/v1/trails/:trailId/versions/:versionId/steps/:stepNumber/evaluations) with the required request body format.

If there are errors in the consumer inputs, you will see the error in the 'finalInputValues' object and request body validation.

<working_with_array_inputs>
Note that array element "inputNames" are flattened with the index, i.e. 'inputs.someArray.{index}' for each new element. And if it's a tuple array then its 'inputs.someTupleArray.{index}.{eachTupleComponent}'. The easiest way to create new elements is by copying from arrayDefaults.
Array defaults are meant to represent the default values for each newly added element, so they don't include the index in the dot path yet.

Make sure to take into account any existing elements already created by the trail creator (check <step_data> for these). Also keep track of the "arrayMaxLength" for each array, if it's greater than -1 then the array can only be that many element long.

So within 'requiredUserInputs' you may see a type like 'inputs.someArray' that comes with arrayDefaults. If a consumer added two elements to this array then it would be added to 'userInputs' as:

```json
userInputs": {
    "nodeId": {
      "inputs.someArray": {
          "value": "" //the actual valueType = 'array' value should be always left as a blank string
      },
      "inputs.someArray.0": {
        "value": "someValue"
      },
      "inputs.someArray.1": {
        "value": "someOtherValue"
      }
      //if this value type has "int" in it, then the arrayDefaults will also contain a "inputs.someArray_decimals" value which would show up like this:
      "inputs.someArray.0_decimals": {
        "value": "someDecimalValue"
      },
      "inputs.someArray.1_decimals": {
        "value": "someOtherDecimalValue"
      }
    }
}
```

And if the array type is a 'tuple[]' then this will look like:

```json
userInputs": {
    "nodeId": {
      "inputs.someTupleArray": {
          "value": "" //the actual valueType = 'array' value should be always left as a blank string
      },
      //you would find this in arrayDefaults already as 'inputs.someTupleArray.componentA' and 'inputs.someTupleArray.componentB', and it may already have a value you can copy over.
      "inputs.someTupleArray.0.componentA": {
        "value": "someValue"
      },
      "inputs.someTupleArray.0.componentB": {
        "value": "someOtherValue"
      },
      "inputs.someTupleArray.1.componentA": {
        "value": "someValue"
      },
      "inputs.someTupleArray.1.componentB": {
        "value": "someOtherValue"
      }
  }
}
```

You only need to copy "user_input" fields from arrayDefaults, you don't need to copy any of the other fields when gathering the required user inputs. Sometimes the array/arrayDefaults intent may also say that you should not add any array elements, in which case you don't even need to surface this array input to the consumer.
</working_with_array_inputs>

The evaluations API will return the transaction calldata to submit to the consumer wallet for signing (sending a transaction to the blockchain).
</submitting_inputs_to_get_transaction_calldata>

<setting_up_wallet_connection_and_transaction_submission>
For building a farcaster miniapp, you'll have to use the farcaster wallet connection and set up a manifest.json for your app (see full docs here https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/llms-full.txt)

VERY IMPORTANT: You must ONLY use the farcaster wallet connector, do not attempt to use any other connectors or any other libraries (no connect kit, rainbow, metamask, injected, etc).

Here's how to setup the farcaster wallet connection and SDK:

1. Create Web3Provider component (Web3Provider.tsx)

```typescript
import { WagmiProvider, createConfig, http } from "wagmi";
import { base } from "wagmi/chains";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { farcasterMiniApp as miniAppConnector } from '@farcaster/miniapp-wagmi-connector';

export const config = createConfig({
  chains: [base],
  transports: {
    [base.id]: http(),
  },
  connectors: [\
    miniAppConnector() //you MUST use this connector, and only this connector.\
  ]
});

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export const Web3Provider = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={config}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        {children}
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
  );
};
```

// 2. Create FarcasterConnect wallet connection component (FarcasterConnect.tsx)
```typescript
'use client';

import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'
import { Wallet } from 'lucide-react'
import { useAccount, useConnect } from 'wagmi'
import { config } from './Web3Provider' //import the config from the Web3Provider component
import { sdk } from '@farcaster/miniapp-sdk'
import type { Context } from '@farcaster/miniapp-sdk'

export function WalletConnector() {
  const { address, status } = useAccount()
  const { connect } = useConnect()
  const [context, setContext] = useState<Context.MiniAppContext | null>(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchContext = async () => {
      const context = await sdk.context
      console.log(context, "context")
      setContext(context)
    }
    fetchContext()
  }, [])

  return (
    <div className="farcaster-connect">
      {status === "connected" && address ? (
        <div
          className="flex items-center gap-2 glass-effect rounded-full px-3 py-2 ghibli-shadow max-w-[110px]"
        >
          <img src={context?.user.pfpUrl} alt="avatar" className="w-4 h-4 rounded-full" />
          <span className="text-ghibli-forest font-medium text-sm">
            {context?.user.username}
          </span>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <button
          onClick={() => connect({ connector: config.connectors[0] })}
          className="flex items-center gap-2 bg-gradient-sunset text-white font-medium px-4 py-2 rounded-full shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl transition-all duration-300"
        >
          <Wallet className="w-4 h-4" />
          <span className="text-sm">Connect Farcaster</span>
        </button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

3. Setup the Main App component and AppContent component, with a call to sdk.actions.ready() when the app is fully loaded.

```typescript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { Web3Provider } from './Web3Provider';
import { FarcasterConnect } from './FarcasterConnect';
import { sdk } from '@farcaster/miniapp-sdk'
import { useAccount } from 'wagmi'

// AppContent must be inside Web3Provider to use wagmi hooks
const AppContent = () => {
  const [isAppReady, setIsAppReady] = useState(false)
  const { address, status } = useAccount() // This is now safely inside WagmiProvider

  // Call sdk.actions.ready() when app is ready. Otherwise, farcaster will show a splash screen to the consumer while loading.
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!isAppReady) {
      const markAppReady = async () => {
        try {
          await sdk.actions.ready()
          setIsAppReady(true)
          console.log('App marked as ready!')
        } catch (error) {
          console.error('Failed to mark app as ready:', error)
          setIsAppReady(true) // Still mark as ready to prevent infinite loading
        }
      }

      // Small delay to ensure UI is rendered
      const timer = setTimeout(() => {
        markAppReady()
      }, 100)

      return () => clearTimeout(timer)
    }
  }, [isAppReady])

  return (
    <div className="app">
      <h1>My Farcaster Mini App</h1>
      <FarcasterConnect />
      {/* Your app content here */}
    </div>
  );
};

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <Web3Provider>
      <AppContent />
    </Web3Provider>
  );
};
```

4. Create the tranaction submission hook, with the post to the executions API after successful transaction submission.

**IMPORTANT**: All wagmi hooks (useAccount, useSendTransaction, etc.) must be used INSIDE components that are wrapped by the Web3Provider. Do not use wagmi hooks in the same component that renders the Web3Provider.

Do NOT create dummy transaction hashes when the consumer submits a transaction in the app, you should always send the transaction to the wallet to be submitted onchain. Here is a working example for sending a transaction and execution that you can copy:

```typescript
import { useAccount, useSendTransaction, useSwitchChain } from 'wagmi'
import { base } from "wagmi/chains";

...in component code...
const { address, status } = useAccount()
const { switchChain } = useSwitchChain();

//switch to the correct chain id for the trail
useEffect(() => {
  if (status === "connected") {
    switchChain({ chainId: base.id });
  }
}, [switchChain, address, status]);

// You can use the useSendTransaction hook from wagmi (https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useSendTransaction).
const { sendTransaction, isPending, error: txError } = useSendTransaction({
  mutation: {
    onSuccess: async (hash: string) => {
      console.log('Transaction successfully sent:', hash)
      try {
        // After confirming the transaction, send the transaction hash back to the executions API
        await fetch(
          `https://trails-api.herd.eco/v1/trails/:trailId/versions/:versionId/executions/:walletAddress/wallet`,
          {
            method: "POST",
            body: JSON.stringify({ nodeId: primaryNodeId, transactionHash: hash, walletAddress: address!, execution: { type: "latest" } }),
          },
        );
      } catch (err) {
        console.error('Failed to submit execution:', err)
      }
    },
    onError: (error: Error) => {
      console.error('Transaction failed:', error)
    }
  }
})

//where this goes in an onClick handler in the UI
const handleSubmit = async (someInputArgsFromFrontend) => {
  // get the call arguments from the evaluations API
  const evaluation = await apiCallToGetEvaluationData(someInputArgsFromFrontend)

  // create transaction request
  const transactionRequest: {
    from: `0x${string}`,
    to: `0x${string}`,
    data: `0x${string}`,
    value: bigint,
  } = {
    from: address as `0x${string}`,
    to: evaluation.contractAddress as `0x${string}`,
    data: evaluation.callData as `0x${string}`,
    value: BigInt(evaluation.payableAmount ?? "0"),
  }

  // send transaction onchain - success/error handling is done in the useSendTransaction callbacks
  sendTransaction(transactionRequest)
}
```

5. Add meta tags to the app layout, so that the miniapp can be correctly rendered/recognized as an embed.

```html
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- head content -->
    <meta name="fc:miniapp" content='{"version":"1","imageUrl":"https://yoink.party/framesV2/opengraph-image","button":{"title":"🚩 Start","action":{"type":"launch_miniapp","name":"Yoink!","url":"https://yoink.party/framesV2","splashImageUrl":"https://yoink.party/logo.png","splashBackgroundColor":"#f5f0ec"}}}' />
    <!-- For backward compatibility -->
    <meta name="fc:frame" content='{"version":"1","imageUrl":"https://yoink.party/framesV2/opengraph-image","button":{"title":"🚩 Start","action":{"type":"launch_frame","name":"Yoink!","url":"https://yoink.party/framesV2","splashImageUrl":"https://yoink.party/logo.png","splashBackgroundColor":"#f5f0ec"}}}' />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- page content -->
  </body>
</html>
```

You'll need to create the server api endpoints that return "content-type: image/png" images set in the meta tags above:
- iconUrl: 1024x1024px max (square, max 1MB). Think of this like a favicon.
- imageUrl: 3:2 aspect ratio, 600x400px minimum, 3000x2000px maximum (max 10MB). Think of this like a thumbnail.
- splashImageUrl: 200x200px (square). This will show as a small icon in the middle of the loading screen for the app, ideally this is animated.

You'll need to generate svgs for each of these endpoints that convert to png images, keep in mind:
- Use modern CSS styles (e.g. filter, transition, fill, stroke, drop-shadow)
- Consider using linearGradient or radialGradient for depth
- Use a modern font (e.g. Inter, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif)
- Use a soft color palette, defaulting to using blue and purple colors.
- Whatever art you draw should have rounded edges, and can be a bit cartoonish.
- Use a modern animation library (e.g. lottie)

Converting to png from svg can be done with sharp:

```typescript
import sharp from "sharp"

const svg = ...some svg string...
const pngBuffer = await sharp(Buffer.from(svg)).png().toBuffer()

...return pngBuffer as image/png content-type...
```

6. After all the code is complete, you'll need to deploy your app:

- Deploy your app to a production domain (not localhost/tunnel). Then provide the URL back to the agent to it can be set correctly in the manifest.

- Sign the manifest to verify ownership:
   - Go to https://farcaster.xyz/~/developers/mini-apps/manifest

- Test your app using the preview tool:
   - https://farcaster.xyz/~/developers/mini-apps/preview?url=YOUR_APP_URL

<mandatory_updating_executions_after_transaction>
This execution API lets you create and/or update an "execution" for a trail by wallet address. Executions keep track of transactions a wallet has made for each step (primary node) in a trail.

After the consumer has submitted the transaction onchain in your farcaster_miniapp, you must call the executions post endpoint (https://trails-api.herd.eco/v1/trails/:trailId/versions/:versionId/executions).

Execution type can be either "latest" or "new", where "latest" is the execution that has most recently been updated (or created). Adding a new transaction to an execution counts as an update.

When submitting a transaction for a given primary nodeId, these are the backend behaviors:
- If you send with execution.type "new": create a new execution and append the transaction as step 1 to it.
- If you send with execution.type "latest", it will either:
  - add the transaction as a step to the "latest" execution if one exists
  - create a new "latest" execution if one doesn't exist, and add the transaction as a step to it
  - if a transaction already exists for this primary nodeId/step in the latest execution, it will "fork" that execution to create a new execution with the same previous step transaction data and append the new transaction to it.
- If you send with execution.type "manual" with an executionId, it will add the transaction as a step to the execution with the given executionId.

If the post to the executions API fails, this likely means the transaction itself has failed - you should ALWAYS return a transaction error to the consumer and give them the hash to investigate.

You can skip a step by sending a transaction hash of 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000. Note that this may potentially break the next steps if the creator of the trail did not intend for a step to be skippable. The creator will have specified this in the node intent.
</mandatory_updating_executions_after_transaction>

<managing_executions_with_execution_history>
To get all executions of a trail, you can use the following execution query POST API (https://trails-api.herd.eco/v1/trails/:trailId/versions/:versionId/executions/query). Note that for a given wallet, each "execution" is a different set of step transactions. Do not merge/flatten across executions, they should be used independently. You should always rely on executions from the API as the source of truth for step/component state, do not try and create a local state.

All executions will have a stepNumber 0 to mark the trail was started, with a transaction hash of 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000. You should filter out this step when showing the consumer any details/counts about transactions. The actual trail steps start counting from 1. The nil tx hash is also used to represent a skipped step, and any read nodes from that step cannot be used if skipped.

Consumers will always use one execution id at a time, where that execution.steps is used to derive the current step number a consumer (wallet address) is on in the trail - you should hide/disable previous steps and any steps that come after the current step.

You should have a single query to the <execution_history_api>. Include the consumer's connected wallet address in the walletAddresses POST body. Then build these components:
- Show the txn hashes within each step component using the walletExecutions[].txnsPerStep list. The consumer should be able to select a transaction to continue executing with that specific execution id (which is the walletExecutions[].txnsPerStep[stepNumber].latestExecutionId).
- Use the totals.stepStats to show total stats per step, and then a feed or leaderboard. The component should mention the step of the transaction, i.e. "X did some action".

For all wallets, you should show the circle pfp_url and username of the wallet (or just the wallet and a person avatar icon with random background color if farcaster data is unavailable).

Executions will only be updated after you submit a transaction, you can have it poll every few minutes for new transactions or anytime the consumer submits a transaction.

Read node data can then be pulled from the <read_node_api> to enhance data around each execution id, make sure to provide the right wallet address and execution id combination when calling the read API and pay attention to the input/output schema as it may not always be the flattened dot path we use for submitting to evaluations.
